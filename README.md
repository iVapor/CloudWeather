## Description of Cloud Weather
* It got a classic brief look. I used callback function get the city name.
Each edit has a new response.
* The website contains three different AJAX fuctions to get realtime weather,
wear advice and weather forecast. Visiting data used a object key which covered 
by a closure.
* The curve is based on ECharts.
